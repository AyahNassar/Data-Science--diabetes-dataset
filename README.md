# diabetes_project
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a machine learning model to predict the onset of diabetes within five years in Pima Indians given medical details. This is a binary classification problem, where the outcome '1' denotes the patient having diabetes, and '0' denotes the patient not having diabetes.
